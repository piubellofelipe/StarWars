This project was made in order to complete a 3-part challenge:
  >1- Develop a StarWars web app, listing any of the SWAPI data with the possibility to see the details of the chosen data, and the possibility to read the details' details too. (done) <br />
  >2- Allow the user to make a search by text input. (done) <br />
  >3- Include a filter in the search (done)
  
Technologies used in the development:
  >basic html/css to give our app a basic (and for now ugly) interface <br />
  >react.js to effectively building the app <br />
  >lodash.debounce to break the search function. without _.debounce the search is search is instantaneous, but the request time makes it slower <br />

  
To-do list:
  >Refactor the whole project, making my own react.js boilerplate (done) <br />
  >Conclude the documentation, as for now all we have is comments about the main functions, it's parameters and returns. <br />
