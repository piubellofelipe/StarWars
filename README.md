>Clone this git, run npm install, run npm start (the app will be available at http://localhost:3000/)
<br /><br />

>this app is now online via github pages. (see this at: https://piubellofelipe.github.io/StarWars <br />
  It shows a welcome alert for the first (and only the first) time you open this webapp! <br />
  It also has google's "add to homescreen" enabled (see: https://developer.chrome.com/multidevice/android/installtohomescreen)


This project was made in order to complete a 3-part challenge:
  >1- Develop a StarWars web app, listing any of the SWAPI data with the possibility to see the details of the chosen data, and the possibility to read the details' details too. (done) <br />
  >2- Allow the user to make a search by text input. (done) <br />
  >3- Include a filter in the search (done)
  
Technologies used in the development:
  >SWAPI, the Star Wars API to gather all the info we needed (see :http://swapi.co/)
  >create-react-app to give us an basic boilerplate (see: https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) <br />
  >basic html/css to give our app a basic (and for now ugly) interface <br />
  >react.js to effectively building the app <br />
  >lodash.debounce to break the search function. without _.debounce the search is search is instantaneous, but the request time makes it slower <br />
